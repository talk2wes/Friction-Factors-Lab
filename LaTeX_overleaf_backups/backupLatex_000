\begin{abstract} 
\noindent A short (up to 250 words) summary of the main contributions of the paper and the context of the research. Full length papers discuss and illustrate methods, challenges, and limitations in the creation, collection, management, access, processing, or analysis of data in humanities research, including standards and formats. These aspects must not necessarily be discussed with reference to a specific dataset (or collection thereof) but, if your paper focusses on particular datasets, we advise to add the dataset metadata under the section ‘Dataset description’. This template provides a general outline for full length papers and authors can adapt the headings and include subheadings as they find appropriate. Please delete or replace the blue text with your own text in black.  \end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
https://www.overleaf.com/project/625369e532850dbb191c2b45
Turbulent flow, characterized in a pipe as Reynolds number >2100, causes fluid streamlines to be random in direction and magnitude, and axial momentum is transferred into the pipe wall and energy is lost as friction.
Pressure drop across the pipe was correlated to the current reading by a transducer, and the friction factor was experimentally determined by relating the fluid flow rate to the pressure drop over a certain length.
The velocity profile will be measured using a pitot tube to experimentally determine the laminar sublayer length.

\section*{Experimental Methods}

The difference between set pump speed and actual pump speed for centrifugal pumps (NPSHr and NPSHa) must be known to get consistent flow rates for each configuration.
The pressure drop was measured using a pressure transducer, where the flow of fluid generates electrical current, and a linear relationship between current and pressure drop was observed to quickly calculate the pressure drop at a given flow rate.
Flow rates were measured by diverting the water flow into a pre-weighed bucket for ~10 seconds, then the water was weighed and the flowrate was determined in kg/s and L/s.
